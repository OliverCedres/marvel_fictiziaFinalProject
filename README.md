# Marvel Characters using Marvel Comics API

Thanks to [Fictizia's Curso-JS-para-desarrolladores-web] (http://www.fictizia.com/formacion/curso_javascript "Curso de JavaScript para desarrolladores web") I discovered the magnificent world of JavaScript and right now I'm still taking my first steps as a front end so it was almost perfect to be able to start with some real experience while learning JavaScript.

That's why I've created this not finished, improvable project using an AJAX call to work with the Marvel Comics API, as a final project and as an excuse to learn a bit more about comics.

Why Marvel? They have Deadpool and Spider-Man, need any other reason?

It's my first time working with calls so please be merciful, coding Majesties.
